Semantic UI 'Blog Template'
======================

[Semantic UI](http://semantic-ui.com/) 'blog template' ported from the [Zurb Foundation blog template](http://foundation.zurb.com/templates/blog.html). Made as an exercise to compare the two frameworks.

Github projects:[https://github.com/Semantic-Org/Semantic-UI](https://github.com/Semantic-Org/Semantic-UI) and [https://github.com/zurb/foundation](https://github.com/zurb/foundation)

Semantic UI doesn't provide any website templates that other responsive frameworks do. It's more of a collection UI elements that can be included within any website or framework. However, it is possible to design an entire site with Semantic UI. So to test this possibility I chose to port the 'blog template' from Zurb Foundation.
