semantic-blog-template
======================

Semantic UI "blog template" ported from the Zurb Foundation blog template. Made as an exercise to compare the two frameworks.

Based on the [Semantic UI](https://github.com/Semantic-Org/Semantic-UI) project. Website: [https://github.com/Semantic-Org/Semantic-UI] (https://github.com/Semantic-Org/Semantic-UI).

Semantic UI doesn't provide any website templates that other responsive frameworks do. It's more of a collection UI elements that can be included within any website or framework. However, it is possible to design an entire site with Semantic UI. So to test this possibility I chose to port the ["blog template"] (http://foundation.zurb.com/templates/blog.html) from the Zurb Foundation [http://foundation.zurb.com/](http://foundation.zurb.com/).
